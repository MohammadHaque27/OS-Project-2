# Operating-Systems-Project-2

Project 2: READ-ME File Example 
 
The project requirements are described in p2-memsim.pdf. Use memory traces that are stored in two files: 
bzip.trace.zip and sixpack.trace.zip. You are to implement a page replacement algorithm presented in this paper.   
Files necessary to compile the program: 
- memsim.c : main interface of the simulator, it takes user input in two forms 
- fifo.c: file that implements first-in first-out replacement policy 
- lru.c: file that implements least recently used policy 
- vms.c: file that implements segmented-fifo polciy 
- dataStructures.c: file that initializes the data structures necessary to run the program such as the page table 
In  addition  to  that  the  folder  must  also  include  policies.h,  and  dataStructures.h.  The  first  one  declares  the  policies 
previously mentioned to be used by the simulator, and the second one makes the dataStructures accessible to all the 
policies. Also, make sure to include any trace file to be tested in the same directory as well. 
 
To compile the program: 
1. You can use command "make" and it will compile all the files for you which creates memsim executable. 
2.  alternatively,  you  can  also  try  "gcc  -o  memsim  memsim.c  fifo.c  lru.c  vms.c  dataStructures.c",  to  compile  the 
program. 
 
To run the program: 
The program can be run with two types of input format 
1. For fifo and lru use the following format: 
./memsim tracefile nFrames policy quiet/debug 
 
2. For segmented fifo use the following format: 
./memsim tracefile nframes policy percentage quiet/debug
